### Explanation of the New Steps

1.  **`r-lib/actions/setup-r@v2`**: This is a standard action that ensures a specific version of R is installed on the virtual machine. It's good practice to include it.
2.  **`r-lib/actions/setup-r-dependencies@v2`**: This is the magic part.
    *   `with: packages:`: We are explicitly telling it which packages to install.
    *   `any::jsonlite`: The `any::` prefix means "install `jsonlite` from any available source (like CRAN)".
    *   `any::purrr`: This does the same for the `purrr` package that was causing the error.

### What To Do Now

1.  Replace the content of your workflow YAML file with the corrected code above.
2.  Commit and push this change to your `main` branch on GitHub.
3.  Go to the "Actions" tab on your GitHub repository and watch the workflow run.

You will see a new step called "Install R dependencies" in the log. It will take a few moments to install `jsonlite` and `purrr`, and then the subsequent step, "Run R script...", will execute successfully because the libraries it needs now exist.
